# Python-Advanced

In Python Advanced, we build on Python language skills by looking at more complex concepts specific to the language. We learned to create linear data structures, solve algorithmic problems (problem solving skills), worked with stacks and queues (Stacks & Queues), tuples and sets (Tuples & Sets), matrices (Multidimensional Lists) as well as files and directories. We turned our attention to the functional programming paradigm. We took a deeper look at recursive functions and functions with multiple arguments.
